# So why build  a Data Model with datamodelr? 
It's a quick and effective way to communicate the structure of data...

.pull-left[
- **Includes** table names, column names, data types and key references

- **Includes** ability to use colors and pretty fonts 

- It's **Open Source** so no software license hassles.
 
]
.pull-right[
- **Doesn't Include** all UML bells and whistles.

-  for example: no ability to specify one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. (future enhancement perhaps?)

### It's especially handy when dealing with alternate data sources!

CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, even Spark tables. If you can read data into R as a dataframe you can visualize it as a data model with a little effort!

# It's so easy... Let's do this...
---
# First
- Download the code from github:  [https://github.com/kfergo55/QuickDataModel](https://github.com/kfergo55/QuickDataModel)  

--

## Next - what's the down low on our data?
- we'll use the public dataset for a fictitious bicycle company called Adventure Works. 

- It's spread across multiple sheets in 2 spreadsheets files 

- We are using the actual data "tables" and not the data definitions (they don't match anyway)

# Setup the Environment
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

install.packages("datamodelr")
library(datamodelr)

install.packages("Diagrammer")
library(DiagrammeR)


```
---
# Read the files

```{r comment='#'}
# set file path -assume home directory for location of files
excel_path1 <- "~/Adventure_Works_Data_Definitions.xlsx"
excel_path2 <- "~/Adventure_Works_version_2.xlsx"

# read in the sheets that have data - ignore the rest
EmployeeHR <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 1)
BusinessEntityAddress <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 2)
Salesperson <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 3)
Contact <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 4)
EmployeePayHistory <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 5)
Address <- read_excel(path=excel_path2, sheet = 6)
SalesTerritory <- read_excel(path=excel_path1, sheet = 8)
SalesOrderHeader <- read_excel(path=excel_path1, sheet = 9)
```
##### variable names -> will be your table names, so choose wisely!

### Here's a peek at the data frames in R...

Employee data: `r knitr::kable(head(EmployeeHR, n=1)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)` Salesperson data: `r knitr::kable(head(Salesperson, n=1)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)` Contact data: `r knitr::kable(head(Contact, n=1))  %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)`

---

Employee Pay History data: `r knitr::kable(head(EmployeePayHistory, n=1)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)` Business Entity Address data: `r knitr::kable(head(BusinessEntityAddress, n=1)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)`  Address data: `r knitr::kable(head(Address, n=1)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)` Sales Territory data: `r knitr::kable(head(SalesTerritory, n=1))  %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)`  

---
AND finally.. Sales Order data: `r knitr::kable(head(SalesOrderHeader, n=10)) %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)`

        
---

class: center, bottom, inverse

# now we throw all of those dataframes at datamodelr... 

---
### datamodelr converts the data frames to a data model 

```{r comment='#'}
datamodel <- dm_from_data_frames(EmployeeHR,
                                 BusinessEntityAddress,
                                 Salesperson, 
                                 Contact, 
                                 EmployeePayHistory, 
                                 Address, 
                                 SalesTerritory,  
                                 SalesOrderHeader)
```


---

### Do a little work here by connecting the data frames:

```{r comment='#', fig.height=4}
datamodel <- dm_add_references(
  datamodel,
  BusinessEntityAddress$`Business Entity ID` == EmployeeHR$`Business Entity ID`,
  BusinessEntityAddress$`Address ID` == Address$`Address ID`,
  Salesperson$`Business Entity ID` == EmployeeHR$`Business Entity ID`,
  Contact$`BusinessEntityID (Person)` == EmployeeHR$`Business Entity ID`,
  EmployeePayHistory$`Business Entity ID` == EmployeeHR$`Business Entity ID`,
  Address$`Territory ID` == SalesTerritory$`Territory ID`,
  SalesOrderHeader$`Sales Person ID` == Salesperson$`Business Entity ID`,
  SalesOrderHeader$`Territory ID` == SalesTerritory$`Territory ID`)
```
#### This is where we join the keys. Child on the left, Parent on the right.
---
background-position: 50% 50%
class: center, bottom, inverse

# Nearly there...
---
### Now datamodelr will create and render the graph  
```{r eval=FALSE}
graph <- dm_create_graph(datamodel, 
              graph_attrs = "rankdir = RL, bgcolor = '#F4F0EF', splines = ortho ", 
              edge_attrs = "dir = both, arrowtail = crow, arrowhead = odiamond",
              node_attrs = "fontname = 'Arial'")

dm_render_graph(graph)
```

#### this will add in a few extras...
- draw the graph from right to left (RL) 
- add a background color 
- square off the lines
- add a diamond connector to the parent table and a crows feet at the child table
- change the font to Arial
